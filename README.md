###A simple customizeable, personal website template
####(in progress, will look terrible for a good while)

___

Person is a mobile-friendly website template designed to have an intuitive feel and simple and smooth UX/UI.

It's designed in order to require as little changes as possible to be done to the template. Just change the text, insert your images, remove sections you don't like, and modify the coloring!

SASS was used as a CSS preprocessor, so it will be easiest to modify the website through the .scss file.
If you're not comfortable using SASS, you can paste the .css file's contents into a CSS simplifier/formatter/optimizer and edit it from there.

The website is viewable at <a href="http://cyrusroshan.me/person">cyrusroshan.me/person</a>

The background was made with <a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/">particles.js</a>.
